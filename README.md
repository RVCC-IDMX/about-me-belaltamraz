Making our own website

This project was the first ever website I made and I lerned alot from it. This is my first my time ever even touching code in my life and I just could't understand it. It just looked like a bunch of random word's and number's next each other. To be honest I never started learning much until After thanksgiving break when I started understading How the style.css works and how to give each section An id. Once I leraned that part everything was kind of simple. Everything seemed to start clicking Right away. I had made multiple color schemes but idecided to stick with the blue and orange. I also used alot of font's. I had used the hover effect and i used css tricks to find out how to do it. I also had added my own video that i had created. I also made a contact part where people can report or get in touch with me.I made my nav bar and made colors hover over when the curser would go over it. There's so much for the pictures's I put a border on them and I did a bunch of small chnage's like puuting a gray backround over the text and it made it look amazing. Overall I am very statisfaied with my work. when I walked in the first class of the year I was very unsure on how this class would be or end up. I think I did a very good job and I feel like accomplishid alot.
