            <h2>The life of smauel Johnson</h2>
            <div>While the world in general was filled with admiration of Johnson's Lives of the Poets, there were
                narrow circles in which prejudice and resentment were fostered, and from which attacks of different
                sorts issued against him. By some violent Whigs he was arraigned of injustice to Milton; by some
                Cambridge men of depreciating Gray; and his expressing with a dignified freedom what he really thought
                of George, Lord Lyttelton, gave offence to some of the friends of that nobleman, and particularly
                produced a declaration of war against him from Mrs. Montagu, the ingenious Essayist on Shakspeare,
                between whom and his Lordship a commerce of reciprocal compliments had long been carried on. In this war
                the smaller powers in alliance with him were of course led to engage, at least on the defensive, and
                thus I for one was excluded from the enjoyment of 'A Feast of Reason,' such as Mr. Cumberland has
                described, with a keen, yet just and delicate pen, in his Observer. These minute inconveniences gave not
                the least disturbance to Johnson. He nobly said, when I talked to him of the feeble, though shrill
                outcry which had been raised, 'Sir, I considered myself as entrusted with a certain portion of truth. I
                have given my opinion sincerely; let them shew where they think me wrong.'
