            <h2>Biography: </h2>
            <li>
                I moved to America when I was in the 6th grade and it was a difficult adjustment. It was really good
                learning about a new culture so fast and see many different face's and races. I lived in Egypt for more
                than half of my life and spoke fluent Arabic and moving to America and trying to speak was defiantly
                hard but it was an easy adjustment after a while. At a young age my parent's Had put in every type of
                sports. I had Swam ever since the age of 5 and I played soccer at the age of 7 and I started playing
                tennis at the age of 8 and I started getting ping pong classes at the age of 12. I also had taken Karta
                class at the age of 8 and reached up to the purple Belt. The only two sports that I stuck with till the
                Age of 17 were soccer and swimming. I believe that's where my love of sport's came from. Playing a lot
                of sport's has definitely helped me and made more competitive not just in sport's case's but also in
                life situation's.

            <h2>The hover Effect and how it's used </h2>
            <div> Image hover effects refer to the visual changes that occur when a user hovers their cursor over an
                image on a webpage. These effects can range from subtle visual enhancements to more dramatic
                transformations, and can be used to add interactivity and engagement to a website. In the Visual Studio
                Code (VSCode) editor, there are several built-in features and extensions that can be used to create and
                customize image hover effects. The hover effect is very simple but complex at the same time as you must
                give it a div class and give each specific picture a div name. I had three pictures on this website and
                for the first picture I named the class < div class=" pic 1 ">. for my second picture I named it < div
                        class=" pic 2 "> and for my third and final photo I named the class < div class=" pic 3 ">.
                            Image hover effects can be useful in a variety of situations, such as providing additional
                            information about an image or offering quick access to image editing tools. However, it is
                            important to use these effects judiciously and consider the potential impact on the user
                            experience. For example, excessive or intrusive hover effects can be distracting and make it
                            difficult for the user to focus on the content of the image. One way to implement image
                            hover effects in VS Code is to use the CSS :hover selector. This allows the developer to
                            specify a set of styles that will be applied to the image when the user's cursor is over it.
            </div>
            <div> For example, the following code could be used to create a simple hover effect that changes the image's
                opacity. Overall, image hover effects can add a level of interactivity and user engagement to a project.
                In VS Code, there are several ways to create these effects, including using extensions, custom CSS, and
                the built-in Hover feature.In VS Code, these effects can be implemented using CSS, and built-in hover
                providers. Image hover effects can provide useful information and options, but should be used carefully
                to avoid impacting the user experience negatively.By taking advantage of these tools, designers and
                developers can create
                engaging and dynamic experiences for their users.MDN Web Docs - MDN Web Docs is a comprehensive resource
                for web developers, and it includes a section on the :hover selector. You can learn more about how the
                :hover selector works, and see some examples of how it can be used.

                CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks is a blog that covers a wide range of topics related to CSS and web development.
                They have written several articles about the :hover selector, which you can read to learn more about how
                it works and how it can be used in your own projects. The W3C CSS Selectors Level 3 specification - This
                specification defines the :hover selector, along with other CSS selectors. You can learn more about how
                the :hover selector works, and how it can be used to apply styles to elements in your web page..
                Overall, the
                use of hover effects on VSCode can add a dynamic and engaging element to a website or application. By
                leveraging the resources mentioned above, it is easy to implement these effects and enhance the user
                experience. .In summary, image hover effects are visual changes that occur when a user moves their
                cursor over an image.
